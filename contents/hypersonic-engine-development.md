# GE Aerospace Achieves Breakthrough in Hypersonic Engine Development

GE Aerospace on 14 December revealed that scientists at its Global Research Center in Upstate New York successfully tested a dual-mode ramjet (DMRJ) engine subscale demonstrator that uses a novel technique called rotating detonation combustion (RDC).

The company says the design could enable high-speed, long-range flight with greater efficiency than what is available with current scramjet engines, for both expendable and reusable vehicles.

The secretive Darkstar aircraft from Top Gun: Maverick used a jet engine to reach M3.5, at which point Maverick flips a few cockpit switches to cut off the craft’s conventional turbine power plant, alter the shape of the air intakes and ignite the scramjet – or DMRJ – powering the fictitious Darkstar beyond M10. The aircraft then malfunctions and Maverick safely ejects. In real life, transitioning between propulsion systems remains a problem.

The physics of conventional DMRJ engines require airspeeds of around M3.5 to achieve compression significant to produce ignition and generate thrust. Current scramjet engines perform most efficiently at M4 and faster. Propulsion engineers must address the speed gap between roughly M3 and M3.5 before crewed hypersonic flight, in a reusable vehicle like the Blackbird, can become a reality.
