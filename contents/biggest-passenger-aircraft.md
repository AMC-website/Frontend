After months of speculation, Air India finally announced what was being discussed in hushed voices within aviation circles. In February, it placed what was, at the time, the biggest aircraft order in history. The carrier ordered a total of 470 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus worth $68 billion at market prices.

Its Airbus deal comprised 70 A321neos and 140 A320neos (it swapped these figures recently), six A350-900s, and 34 A350-1000s (later tweaked to 20 for each type). With Boeing, it ordered 190 737 MAXs and 20 Boeing 787s and also became a 777X customer, ordering 10 of the type.
