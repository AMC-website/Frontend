# India’s Tejas Mk1a Takes First Flight

The first Tejas Mk-1A aircraft on Thursday made its maiden flight from a Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) facility in Bengaluru, and the country can look forward to its early induction into the Indian Air Force (IAF).

The Tejas Mk-1A will have an advanced electronic radar, superior warfare capabilities, and improved maintenance features.

LCA Mk-1A is an advanced variant of the LCA Mk-1, which has already been inducted by IAF. LCA is set to emerge as the cornerstone of IAF’s combat power in the coming decade and beyond.

IAF, the world’s fourth-largest air force, is expected to operate around 350 LCAs (Mk-1, Mk-1A, and Mk-2 versions), with a third of those already ordered, some inducted, and the rest figuring prominently on the air force’s modernization roadmap and expected to be contracted in the coming years.
