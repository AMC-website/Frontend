# ISRO Successfully Lands 'Pushpak', India’s First Reusable Launch Vehicle

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully carried out the landing mission of its Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) named 'Pushpak' from the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) in Challakere near Karnataka's Chitradurga.

Pushpak was lifted by an Indian Airforce Chinook helicopter and was released from 4.5 km altitude. After release at a distance of 4 km from the runway, Pushpak autonomously approached the runway along with cross-range corrections. It landed precisely on the runway and came to a halt using its brake parachute, landing gear brakes, and nose wheel steering system.

The project, which has been in development for over a decade, previously saw a successful test in April last year, where the vehicle demonstrated an autonomous landing after being released from an Indian Air Force Chinook helicopter. This marked a critical milestone for the Pushpak RLV, bringing it closer to achieving orbital re-entry capabilities.
